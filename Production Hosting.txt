App Hosting Service Intro
You’ve probably heard of an app hosting service before, many different vendors have them, each with their own special name: AWS has Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud has App Engine,
Azure’s is App Service and there’s also Heroku, along with many more. While the nuances of their configuration differ,
at a high level they behave the same. The vendor provides a tool (usually command-line based) that you run to upload your code to their platform. 
There might be a web-UI to configure environment variables, and the vendor might also provide load balancing services or other extra monitoring tools.
You’ll probably have to use the vendor’s database (and other) services, which might cost extra.
Virtual Servers Intro

* Provide extra tools like monitoring and load balancing
* Graphical configuration tools
* Easier to scale if needed

A virtual server, or virtual private server, is a cloud-hosted virtual server which you have full access to. It’s like a computer,
hosted somewhere, that you can log into and run whatever you like on. You’ll need to configure all the services that you need including web and application servers,
databases and so on. Security is also your responsibility, so things like firewalls, OS updates and patches need to be managed. 
You get to decide how your application is uploaded and updated on the server, 
which gives you more flexibility but can be a little more difficult – there’s no vendor-provided command to do it all. AWS, 
Google Cloud and Azure all have virtual server offerings, plus there are a plethora of other providers.

* Cost - virtual servers tend to be less expensive due to the user having to do all the work themselves.
* Flexibility - users can configure the server the way they want instead of using vendor specific software.
* Data persistence - virtual servers give users direct access to the file system, which makes data persistence easier.
* Standardization - the processing of setting up and maintaining a virtual sever is very similar across vendors.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to hosting your Django application. If you’re hosting a single Django application with no extra services, 
and are happy to use vendor provide databases and data stores, then an app hosting service might be the best approach. Otherwise, 
if you’re looking to save costs and are happy with server administration duties then a virtual server could be the want. 
Either way, this introduction should have given you some extra context in which to make your decision.
